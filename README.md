# Guessitivity Principle

Welcome to **Guessitivity Principle**, where artificial intelligence meets the art of deduction in a stimulating intellectual exercise. This game challenges the AI's ability to infer and guess a number you have in mind within a defined range.

## Features

- **Cognitive Challenge**: Engage with an AI that uses logical reasoning to uncover your secret number.
- **Performance Metrics**: Track the AIâ€™s efficiency, including the number of guesses and the time taken to identify the correct number.



## Usage

To commence the game:

1. **Define the Range**:
    Set the lower and upper bounds within which the AI will guess.

2. **Think of a Number**:
    Choose a number within the established range.

3. **Provide Feedback**:
    As the AI makes guesses, indicate whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct:
    - **H** or **High**: The guess is too high.
    - **L** or **Low**: The guess is too low.
    - **C** or **Correct**: The guess is accurate.

The game will record the number of attempts and the time required for the AI to deduce your number.
